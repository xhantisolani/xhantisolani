## Personal Story  
During my undergraduate studies, I experienced a life-changing event when I became an above-knee amputee. This period taught me more about myself than I could ever put into words. It was the most challenging time in my life, but my greatest achievement is making it through university during this adversity.  

Through resilience, determination, and a relentless desire to grow, Iâ€™ve developed the strength to pursue my dreams and make an impact in technology.
